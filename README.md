# Project Terminal

A web interpretation of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with a BASH shell, recreated using a minimalist front-end technology approach.

This project was done purely for fun, and to practice modern JS scripting techniques. The functionality of the application mainly focuses on file system navigation.

[A live version of the application can be found here](https://zdm-terminal.surge.sh/).

**Inspiration:** This original idea  was inspired by [Collin Schneider](https://github.com/CollinSchneider), who originally came up with the idea for his [personal portfolio](https://github.com/CollinSchneider/collinschneider.github.io).
